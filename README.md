# JavaScript Arrays Activity

Activiy should be done in groups, size 2-4. 

## Activity 1 - Rank Grades

### Objective 

Create an app that will take an array of student scores and output to the web page class metrics

Write out the logic to accomplish this objective first. This will be your game plan for writing the solution with code

Each step should be completed by a new group member as the rest of the group helps

### Setup

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Add all members as contributers to the new fork
3. All memebers should **clone** the new forked repository to their projects folder
4. Create an HTML file for this app (index.html is fine)
5. Add the global structure into the HTML file
6. Create a *js* folder
7. Create a JavaScript file in this folder. Name it whatever you want
8. In the HTML file, connect the newly create JavaScript file
9. Preview in a web browser to confirm page is setup correctly
10. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
11. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 2

1. Open the js file and create an array of 20 random numbers. The values between should be between 0-100
2. Using the 'getElementById' method, print all scores to the webpage
3. Add *total number of students* to the output

### Step 3

Print the following data to the webpage:

* Highest Score
* Lowest Score

### Step 4

Print the following data to the webpage:

* Average Score
* Median Score

### Step 5

Determine which students scores 70% or higher and move their scores to a new array

## Activity 2 - Magic 8 Ball

### Objective

Create an app that asks the user to enter a question and then reposponds with a ambiguos answers. If their input doesn't end with a '?', ask the user to enter input that is a question

Remember: start with difining your logic before you code
